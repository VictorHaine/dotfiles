pedrofranceschi's dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles. I created them almost from scratch when I started using zsh + tmux and adapted them to my needs, although [thalesmello's dotfiles](https://github.com/thalesmello/dotfiles) were good source of inspiration.

#### What's included

* [My vimfiles](https://github.com/pedrofranceschi/vimfiles)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
